## 9/25/2025 - Started Working on the PCB!

I started working on my timer! I decided to make it a simple project, but wanted it to have the ability to make more complex later for software. I chose to use a ESP32 C3 WROOM as I don't need that many gpio pins and want WiFi and bluetooth connectivity for my project. I am also using a 0.91in oled display and an EC11 rotary encoder!
